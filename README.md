This is a repository that contains my solution for assignments from the course EECS 498-007 [(2020 version)](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/FA2020/). The lecture videos from 2019 are found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r). The course teaches deep learning methods used for computer vision applications.
